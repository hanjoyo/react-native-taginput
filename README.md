[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/react-native-scrollable-tab-view.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/react-native-scrollable-tab-view)

This is probably my favorite navigation pattern on Android, I wish it
were more common on iOS! This is a very simple JavaScript-only
implementation of it for React Native. For more information about how
the animations behind this work, check out the Rebound section of the
[React Native Animation Guide](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/animations.html)


## Add it to your project

1. Run `npm install react-native-taginput --save`
2. `import TagInput from 'react-native-taginput`

## Basic usage

```javascript
var ScrollableTabView = require('react-native-scrollable-tab-view');

var App = React.createClass({
  render() {
    return (
      <ScrollableTabView>
        <ReactPage tabLabel="React" />
        <FlowPage tabLabel="Flow" />
        <JestPage tabLabel="Jest" />
      </ScrollableTabView>
